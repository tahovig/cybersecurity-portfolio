Cybersecurity Portfolio for Theodore "Alex" Hovig

My name is Alex. From military service I have built a dedication to team and proven adaptability within dynamic problem spaces. Along with a strong foundation in software development, I am eager to combine these capabilities with relevant cybersecurity practicies and tools to identify and mitigate threats that could jeopardize people, assets and information.
